Dear js.org Team,

I am the initiator of the Code Notation Manager (CNM) project. Although I understand that new NS record applications are no longer accepted, given the uniqueness and needs of the CNM project, I still hope to apply for the NS record for `cnm.js.org`.

The CNM project is a tool developed using languages such as JavaScript, Go, and Python (mainly based on JavaScript), aimed at providing code notation management. The core code of the project is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/betterdatas/cnm_js_data), and we are actively developing it. For CNM, `cnm.js.org` is not just an ideal domain name but also a crucial part of our brand and community building.

My application for an NS record stems from considerations for the project's future expansion and to prevent potential misuse of the `js.org` domain. We plan to set up subdomains like `feedback.cnm.js.org`, `community.cnm.js.org`, and `extension.cnm.js.org` to support the project's diversified development. Applying for each subdomain separately would undoubtedly bring unnecessary burdens to the js.org team.

I fully understand and am willing to comply with all regulations and guidelines regarding NS domains and promise not to misuse the `js.org` domain. I am passionate about the CNM project and believe it can bring value to the developer community.

Thank you to the js.org team for taking the time to review my application and to @mattcowley for patiently responding to my emails. I wish all team members smooth work and all the best.

If you agree to my application, please direct the NS records to `vita.ns.cloudflare.com` and `lou.ns.cloudflare.com`. If there are any questions, or more information is needed, please feel free to contact me at betterdatas@proton.me.

Regardless of the outcome, I sincerely appreciate your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Betterdatas.
